# Smart Weighing Scale Firmware 
The firmware is developed on PlatformIO and built on the Arduino Framework. The main runtime file 'main.cpp' (equivalent of .ino file) and the root library 'WeighModule' were programmed specifically for the ESP32. Hence, review and modification is required to modularize the firmware for other Arduino boards.
